# The coucou repository

## Description
   This repository contains my dot-files.
   Here's a list of all actuals config:
   - emacs.d
   - bashrc
   More config file will probably come someday. I did not write a install script as I don't have enough files for it to be relevant.
   Actually I think the only interesting thing for you to look at is my emacs config.

## Emacs
   My emacs config is written in a org-mode file, which makes it easily readable ! (`emacs.d/configuration.org`)
   The only line in init.el tells emacs to load the config from the org file at launch.
   If I haven't done anything wrong (hmmm) you can just copy the directory to `$HOME/.emacs.d` and run emacs. Everything should work fine.
