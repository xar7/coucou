# The coucou repository

   This repository contains my configurations files.  
   Here's a list of current configs available here:
   - emacs.d
   - kitty
   - i3
   
   I also have a Makefile which should be able to install these configurations properly. Note that I used the verb *should* as this Makefile is probably completely broken.
